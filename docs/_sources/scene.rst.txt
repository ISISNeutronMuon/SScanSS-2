Scene Management
################
The graphics window is the main window in SScanSS-2 and is essential for visualizing many operations. The graphics window will
render one of two scenes: the first showing the sample preparation "*Sample Scene*" and the second the instrument "*Instrument Scene*".

************
Toggle scene
************
SScanSS-2 will switch to the most appropriate scene for the current operation. To switch between scenes manually use the
shortcut **Ctrl + T** or click the |toggle| button in the toolbar

**********
Navigation
**********
Scene navigation does not move the sample but rather the camera viewing the sample. Navigating in the 3D space
is done with the use of both mouse movement and keyboard shortcuts. The following shortcuts are useful for
navigating the scene:

==================      ===================
Shortcut                Action
==================      ===================
Left Mouse Click        Rotate View
Right Mouse Click       Pan or Move View
Mouse Scroll Wheel      Zoom in or out View
Ctrl + 0                Reset Camera View
Ctrl + 1                Camera View +X Axis
Ctrl + 2                Camera View -X Axis
Ctrl + 3                Camera View +Y Axis
Ctrl + 4                Camera View +Y Axis
Ctrl + 5                Camera View +Z Axis
Ctrl + 6                Camera View +Z Axis
==================      ===================

The |camera| toolbar menu can also be used to quickly switch between camera views.

************************
Change sample appearance
************************
The sample colour can be changed from the :ref:`preference dialog <change preferences>`.The sample shading can be changed
to the following:

* **Solid**: The sample is rendered as a solid object. Click **View > Solid** to activate or the |solid| icon from the toolbar.
* **Wireframe**: Only the edges of the triangles that make up the sample mesh are drawn. Click **View > Wireframe** to
  activate or the |wireframe| icon from the toolbar.
* **Transparent** (default): This is useful to view the internal structure of the sample. Click **View > Transparent** to
  activate or the |transparent| icon from the toolbar.

.. note:: This action is global i.e. it is applied in all scenes so the sample will always be rendered using the
    active shading style irrespective of the scene or the operation.

*******************
Hide and show items
*******************
The 3D models representing the fiducials, measurements, vectors and the coordinate frame can be hidden or shown by
clicking the appropriate toggle in the **View** menu or the |eye| toolbar menu. This could useful when the scene is
cluttered by too many items. This action is also global so hiding fiducials in the sample scene will hide them in
the instrument scene.
