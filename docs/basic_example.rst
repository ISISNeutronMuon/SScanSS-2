=============
Basic Example
=============
This tutorial illustrates the basic ideas behind the SScanSS 2 software. The files used in this tutorial can be
found in the *examples/simple* folder in the install directory. This tutorial uses the ENGIN-X instrument and the steps
shown should apply to other instruments.

We begin by creating a new project, click **File**, and then click **New Project**. You will see the new project dialog.
Type in a project name, select ENGIN-X as the instrument and click create.

Setting up the Sample
*********************

1. Click **Insert > Sample > File** and browse to the location of the data folder and select **simple.stl**.
You will see the sample model in the graphics window.

2. Click **Insert > Fiducial Points > File** and browse to the location of the data folder and select
**simple.fiducial**. You will see the green spheres added in the graphics window.

3. Click **Insert > Measurement Points > File** and browse to the location of the data folder and select
**simple.measurement**. You will see the green crosses added in the graphics window.

3. Click **Insert > Measurement Vectors > Select Strain Component** the select stain component "Parallel to X Axis".
Click **Add Measurement Vectors** and in the graphics window, you will see the blue line segments drawn from the
measurement point along the X Axis.

*****************
Simulating a Scan
*****************

1. Before we can simulate, the sample must be aligned on the instrument. To do this, go to
**Instrument > Align Sample on Instrument > 6D Pose**, you will see a new dialog and the model of the
instrument in the graphics window.

2. Specify a Z Axis translation of -200 and X Axis Rotation of 90. Click Align Sample, you see the
sample model, fiducials, measurement points and vector

3. Start a new simulation by clicking **Simulation > Run Simulation** or the **F5** key. You will see the instrument
move the sample into the appropriate position and orientation for each measurement and the results displayed in
simulation window

4. The script to perform the measurement on the real world instrument (if the sample was mount exactly the same) can be
exported by clicking **File > Export > Script** and then click **Export** on the script dialog.
